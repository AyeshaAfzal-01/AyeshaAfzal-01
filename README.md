# Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="30"/>
I’m [**Ayesha**](https://ayesha-afzal-portfolio.vercel.app/), a developer based in Pakistan.  

I love bringing ideas to life through clean, functional, and creative code. Whether it’s building full-stack projects, experimenting with new tools, or exploring AI & ML, I’m always excited to learn and improve.  

With knowledge of C, C++, Python, and MERN stack development, I enjoy working across different technologies and finding the best way to solve problems.  

Outside of coding, you’ll find me listening to music, drawing, or exploring new creative hobbies.  

**Fun Facts:**  
- I enjoy late-night walks when the streets are quiet.  
- I often doodle on paper while thinking.
