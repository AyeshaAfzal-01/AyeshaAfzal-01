# Hi there!  
I’m Ansa, a developer based in Pakistan.  

I love bringing ideas to life through clean, functional, and creative code. Whether it’s building full-stack projects or experimenting with new tools, I’m always excited to learn and improve.  

Outside of coding, you’ll find me listening to music, drawing, or exploring new creative hobbies.  

**Fun Facts:**  
- I enjoy mixing art with tech.  
- Music keeps me in the zone while coding.  
- I’m always curious to try something new.
